# Power BI Loan Default Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** built on a dataset of 250K+ loan records.  
The goal is to analyze **borrower risk patterns, repayment behavior, and lending trends** using data modeling, DAX measures, and visualization techniques.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Used Power Query for data type corrections, null handling, and profiling.  
- **Data Modeling**: Created calculated columns (Age Groups, Credit Score Bins, Income Brackets) to segment borrower demographics.  
- **DAX Measures**: Developed measures for Loan Amount by Purpose, Average Income by Employment Type, Default Rate by Year, Median Loan by Credit Score, YOY Growth, and YTD Loans.  
- **Visualizations**: Designed line charts, ribbon charts, donut charts, decomposition trees, and clustered columns to explore trends.  
- **Validation**: Cross-checked Power BI results with Excel pivot tables for accuracy.  

## Insights & Results
- Borrowers with **Low credit scores** took larger loans but had **higher default risk**.  
- **YOY default rates peaked in 2015–2016**, while loans grew sharply in 2018.  
- **Full-time workers** showed the highest average income, while unemployed had the lowest.  
- **Middle-aged adults with mortgages** contributed the largest loan volumes.  
- Education analysis showed **Bachelor’s degree holders** had the highest number of loans.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** (DAX, Power Query, Data Modeling, Custom Visualizations)  
- **Excel** (Pivot Tables for validation)  
- **Dataset**: Loan Default dataset (250K+ records)
